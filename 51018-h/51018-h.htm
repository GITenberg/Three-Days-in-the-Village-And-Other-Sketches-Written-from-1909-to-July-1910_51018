<h2 id="village">THREE DAYS IN THE VILLAGE</h2>

<h3 id="first"><i>FIRST DAY</i><br />
TRAMPS</h3>

<p>Something entirely new, unseen and unheard-of
formerly, has lately shown itself in
our country districts. To our village, consisting
of eighty homesteads, from half a dozen to
a dozen cold, hungry, tattered tramps come every
day, wanting a night's lodging.</p>

<p>These people, ragged, half-naked, barefoot,
often ill, and extremely dirty, come into the
village and go to the village policeman. That
they should not die in the street of hunger and
exposure, he quarters them on the inhabitants
of the village, regarding only the peasants as
"inhabitants." He does not take them to the
squire, who besides his own ten rooms has
ten other apartments: office, coachman's room,
laundry, servants' and upper-servants' hall and
so on; nor does he take them to the priest or
deacon or shopkeeper, in whose houses, though
not large, there is still some spare room; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
takes them to the peasants, whose whole family,
wife, daughters-in-law, unmarried daughters, and
big and little children, all live in one room&mdash;sixteen,
nineteen, or twenty-three feet long. And
the master of the hut takes the cold, hungry,
stinking, ragged, dirty man, and not merely gives
him a night's lodging, but feeds him as well.</p>

<p>"When you sit down to table yourself," an
old peasant householder told me, "it's impossible
not to invite him too, or your own soul accepts
nothing. So one feeds him and gives him a
drink of tea."</p>

<p>Those are the nightly visitors. But during the
day, not two or three, but ten or more such
visitors call at each hut, and again it is: "Why,
it is impossible...," etc.</p>

<p>And for almost every tramp the housewife cuts
a slice of bread, thinner or thicker according to
the man's appearance&mdash;though she knows her rye
will not last till next harvest.</p>

<p>"If you were to give to all who come, a loaf
[the big peasant loaf of black bread] would not
last a day," some housewives said to me. "So
sometimes one hardens one's heart and refuses!"</p>

<p>And this goes on every day, all over Russia.
An enormous yearly-increasing army of beggars,
cripples, administrative exiles, helpless old men,
and above all unemployed workmen, lives&mdash;that
is to say, shelters itself from cold and wet&mdash;and
is actually fed by the hardest-worked and poorest
class, the country peasants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
We have Workhouses,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Foundlings' Hospitals,
Boards of Public Relief, and all sorts of philanthropic
organisations in our towns; and in all
those institutions, in buildings with electric light,
parquet floors, neat servants, and various well-paid
attendants, thousands of helpless people of
all sorts are sheltered. But however many such
there may be, they are but a drop in the ocean of
the enormous (unnumbered, but certainly enormous)
population which now tramps destitute over Russia,
and is sheltered and fed apart from any institutions,
solely by the village peasants whose own
Christian feelings induce them to bear this heavy
and gigantic tax.</p>

<p>Just think what people who are not peasants
would say, if&mdash;even once a week&mdash;such a shivering,
starving, dirty, lousy tramp were placed in
each of their bedrooms! But the peasants not
only house them, but feed them and give them
tea, because "one's own soul accepts nothing
unless one has them to table."</p>

<p>In the more remote parts of Sarátof, Tambóf,
and other Provinces, the peasants do not wait for
the policeman to bring these tramps, but always
receive them and feed them of their own accord.</p>

<p>And, as is the case with all really good deeds,
the peasants do this without knowing that they
are doing a good deed; and yet it is not merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a good deed "for one's soul," but is of enormous
importance for the whole of Russian society. It
is of such importance for Russian society because,
but for this peasant population and the Christian
feeling that lives so strongly in it, it is difficult to
imagine what the fate would be, not only of these
hundreds of thousands of unfortunate, houseless
tramps, but of all the well-to-do&mdash;and especially of
the wealthy who have their houses in the country.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to see the state of privation
and suffering to which these homeless tramps have
come or have been brought, and to imagine the
mental condition they must be in, and to realise
that it is only this help rendered to them by the
peasants that restrains them from committing
violence, which would be quite natural in their
position, upon those who possess in superfluity
all the things these unfortunates lack to keep
themselves alive.</p>

<p>So that it is not the philanthropic organisations,
not the Government with its police and all its
juridical institutions, that protects us, the well-to-do,
from being attacked by those who wander,
cold, hungry, and homeless, after having sunk&mdash;or,
for the most part, having been brought&mdash;to the
lowest depths of poverty and despair; but we are
protected, as well as fed and supported, by that
same basic strength of the Russian nation&mdash;the
peasantry.</p>

<p>Yes! Were it not that there is among Russia's
vast peasant population a deep religious conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ness
of the brotherhood of all men, not only
would these homeless people, having reached the
last stages of despair, have long since destroyed
the houses of the rich, in spite of any police force
(there are and must be so few of them in country
districts), but they would even have killed all who
stood in their way. So that we ought not to be
horrified or surprised when we hear or read of
people being robbed, or killed that they may be
robbed, but we should understand and remember
that if such things happen as seldom as they do,
we owe this to the unselfish help rendered by the
peasants to this unfortunate tramping population.</p>

<p>Every day from ten to fifteen people come to
our house to beg. Some among them are regular
beggars, who for some reason have chosen that
means of livelihood, and having clothed and shod
themselves as best they might, and having made
sacks to hold what they collect, have started out to
tramp the country. Among them some are blind,
and some have lost a leg or an arm; and sometimes,
though rarely, there are women and children
among them. But these are only a small part.
The majority of the beggars that come now are
passers-by, without a beggar's sack, mostly young,
and not crippled. They are all in a most pitiable
state, barefoot, half-naked, emaciated, and shivering
with cold. You ask them, "Where are you
going?" The answer is always the same: "To
look for work"; or, "Have been looking for
work, but found none, and am making my way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
home. There's no work; they are shutting down
everywhere." Many of these people are returning
from exile.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was barely awake when our
servant, Ilyá Vasílyevitch, told me:</p>

<p>"There are five tramps waiting near the porch."</p>

<p>"Take some money there is on the table, and
give it them," said I.</p>

<p>Ilyá Vasílyevitch took it, and, as is the custom,
gave each of them five copecks [five farthings].
About an hour passed. I went out into the porch.
A dreadfully tattered little man with a sickly
face, swollen eyelids, restless eyes, and boots all
falling to pieces, began bowing, and held out a
certificate to me.</p>

<p>"Have you received something?"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, what am I to do with five
copecks?... Your Excellency, put yourself in
my place! Please, your Excellency, look ...
please see!" and he shows me his clothing.
"Where am I to go to, your Excellency?" (it is
"Excellency" after every word, though his face
expresses hatred). "What am I to do? Where
am I to go?"</p>

<p>I tell him that I give to all alike. He continues
to entreat, and demands that I should read
his certificate. I refuse. He kneels down. I ask
him to leave me.</p>

<p>"Very well! That means, it seems, that I must
put an end to myself! That's all that's left me to
do.... Give me something, if only a trifle!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>I give him twenty copecks, and he goes away,
evidently angry.</p>

<p>There are a great many such peculiarly insistent
beggars, who feel they have a right to demand
their share from the rich. They are literate for
the most part, and some of them are even well-read
persons on whom the Revolution has had
an effect. These men, unlike the ordinary, old-fashioned
beggars, look on the rich, not as on
people who wish to save their souls by distributing
alms, but as on highwaymen and robbers who
suck the blood of the working classes. It often
happens that a beggar of this sort does no work
himself and carefully avoids work, and yet considers
himself, in the name of the workers, not
merely justified, but bound, to hate the robbers of
the people&mdash;that is to say, the rich&mdash;and to hate
them from the depths of his heart; and if, instead
of demanding from them, he begs, that is only a
pretence.</p>

<p>There are a great number of these men, many
of them drunkards, of whom one feels inclined to
say, "It's their own fault"; but there are also a
great many tramps of quite a different type: meek,
humble, and very pathetic, and it is terrible to
think of their position.</p>

<p>Here is a tall, good-looking man, with nothing
on over his short, tattered jacket. His boots are
bad and trodden down. He has a good, intelligent
face. He takes off his cap and begs in the
ordinary way. I give him something, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thanks me. I ask him where he comes from and
where he is going to.</p>

<p>"From Petersburg, home to our village in
Toúla Government."</p>

<p>I ask him, "Why on foot?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story," he answers, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>I ask him to tell it me. He relates it with
evident truthfulness.</p>

<p>"I had a good place in an office in Petersburg,
and received thirty roubles [three guineas] a month.
Lived very comfortably. I have read your books
<i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karénina</i>," says he, again
smiling a particularly pleasant smile. "Then my
folks at home got the idea of migrating to Siberia,
to the Province of Tomsk." They wrote to him
asking whether he would agree to sell his share of
land in the old place. He agreed. His people
left, but the land allotted them in Siberia turned
out worthless. They spent all they had, and came
back. Being now landless, they are living in
hired lodgings in their former village, and work
for wages. It happened, just at the same time,
that he lost his place in Petersburg. It was not
his doing. The firm he was with became bankrupt,
and dismissed its employees. "And just
then, to tell the truth, I came across a seamstress."
He smiled again. "She quite entangled me....
I used to help my people, and now see what a
smart chap I have become!... Ah well, God is
not without mercy; maybe I'll manage somehow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>He was evidently an intelligent, strong, active
fellow, and only a series of misfortunes had
brought him to his present condition.</p>

<p>Take another: his legs swathed in strips of rag;
girdled with a rope; his clothing quite threadbare
and full of small holes, evidently not torn, but
worn-out to the last degree; his face, with its
high cheek-bones, pleasant, intelligent, and sober.
I give him the customary five copecks, and he
thanks me and we start a conversation. He has
been an administrative exile in Vyátka. It was
bad enough there, but it is worse here. He is
going to Ryazán, where he used to live. I ask
him what he has been. "A newspaper man. I
took the papers round."</p>

<p>"For what were you exiled?"</p>

<p>"For selling forbidden literature."</p>

<p>We began talking about the Revolution. I told
him my opinion, that the evil was all in ourselves;
and that such an enormous power as that of the
Government cannot be destroyed by force. "Evil
outside ourselves will only be destroyed when we
have destroyed it within us," said I.</p>

<p>"That is so, but not for a long time."</p>

<p>"It depends on us."</p>

<p>"I have read your book on Revolution."</p>

<p>"It is not mine, but I agree with it."</p>

<p>"I wished to ask you for some of your books."</p>

<p>"I should be very pleased.... Only I'm afraid
they may get you into trouble. I'll give you the
most harmless."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care! I am no longer afraid of
anything.... Prison is better for me than this!
I am not afraid of prison.... I even long for it
sometimes," he said sadly.</p>

<p>"What a pity it is that so much strength is
wasted uselessly!" said I. "How people like
you destroy your own lives!... Well, and
what do you mean to do now?"</p>

<p>"I?" he said, looking intently into my face.</p>

<p>At first, while we talked about past events and
general topics, he had answered me boldly and
cheerfully; but as soon as our conversation referred
to himself personally and he noticed my sympathy,
he turned away, hid his eyes with his sleeve, and
I noticed that the back of his head was shaking.</p>

<p>And how many such people there are!</p>

<p>They are pitiable and pathetic, and they, too,
stand on the threshold beyond which a state of
despair begins that makes even a kindly man
ready to go all lengths.</p>

<p>"Stable as our civilisation may seem to us,"
says Henry George, "disintegrating forces are
already developing within it. Not in deserts and
forests, but in city slums and on the highways,
the barbarians are being bred who will do for our
civilisation what the Huns and Vandals did for
the civilisation of former ages."</p>

<p>Yes! What Henry George foretold some
twenty years ago, is happening now before our
eyes, and in Russia most glaringly&mdash;thanks to the
amazing blindness of our Government, which care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>fully
undermines the foundations on which alone
any and every social order stands or can stand.</p>

<p>We have the Vandals foretold by Henry George
quite ready among us in Russia. And, strange as
it may seem to say so, these Vandals, these doomed
men, are specially dreadful here among our deeply
religious population. These Vandals are specially
dreadful here, because we have not the restraining
principles of convention, propriety, and public
opinion, that are so strongly developed among the
European nations. We have either real, deep,
religious feeling, or&mdash;as in Sténka Rázin and Pougatchéf&mdash;a
total absence of any restraining principle:
and, dreadful to say, this army of Sténkas
and Pougatchéfs is growing greater and greater,
thanks to the Pougatchéf-like conduct of our
Government in these later days, with its horrors
of police violence, insane banishments, imprisonments,
exiles, fortresses, and daily executions.</p>

<p>Such actions release the Sténka Rázins from the
last remnants of moral restraint. "If the learned
gentlefolk act like that, God Himself permits us to
do so," say and think they.</p>

<p>I often receive letters from that class of men,
chiefly exiles. They know I have written something
about not resisting evil by violence, and for
the greater part they retort ungrammatically,
though with great fervour, that what the Government
and the rich are doing to the poor, can and
must be answered only in one way: "Revenge,
revenge, revenge!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes! The blindness of our Government is
amazing. It does not and will not see that all it
does to disarm its enemies merely increases their
number and energy. Yes! These people are
terrible, terrible for the Government and for the
rich, and for those who live among the rich.</p>

<p>But besides the feeling of terror these people
inspire, there is also another feeling, much more
imperative than that of fear, and one we cannot
help experiencing towards those who, by a series
of accidents, have fallen into this terrible condition
of vagrancy. That feeling is one of shame and
sympathy.</p>

<p>And it is not fear, so much as shame and pity,
that should oblige us, who are not in that condition,
to respond in one way or other to this new
and terrible phenomenon in Russian life.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3 id="second"><i>SECOND DAY</i><br />
THE LIVING AND THE DYING</h3>

<p>As I sat at my work, Ilyá Vasílyevitch entered
softly and, evidently reluctant to disturb me
at my work, told me that some wayfarers and
a woman had been waiting a long time to see me.</p>

<p>"Here," I said, "please take this, and give it
them."</p>

<p>"The woman has come about some business."</p>

<p>I told him to ask her to wait a while, and continued
my work. By the time I came out, I had
quite forgotten about her, till I saw a young
peasant woman with a long, thin face, and clad
very poorly and too lightly for the weather, appear
from behind a corner of the house.</p>

<p>"What do you want? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I've come to see you, your Honour."</p>

<p>"Yes ... what about? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"To see you, your Honour."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"He's been taken wrongfully.... I'm left
with three children."</p>

<p>"Who's been taken, and where to?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"My husband ... sent off to Krapívny."</p>

<p>"Why? What for?"</p>

<p>"For a soldier, you know. But it's wrong&mdash;because,
you see, he's the breadwinner! We
can't get on without him.... Be a father to
us, sir!"</p>

<p>"But how is it? Is he the only man in the
family?"</p>

<p>"Just so ... the only man!"</p>

<p>"Then how is it they have taken him, if he's
the only man?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell why they've done it?...
Here am I, left alone with the children! There's
nothing for me but to die.... Only I'm sorry
for the children! My last hope is in your kindness,
because, you see, it was not right!"</p>

<p>I wrote down the name of her village, and her
name and surname, and told her I would see about
it and let her know.</p>

<p>"Help me, if it's only ever so little!... The
children are hungry, and, God's my witness, I
haven't so much as a crust. The baby is worst
of all ... there's no milk in my breasts. If
only the Lord would take him!"</p>

<p>"Haven't you a cow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A cow? Oh, no!... Why, we're all
starving!" said she, crying, and trembling all
over in her tattered coat.</p>

<p>I let her go, and prepared for my customary
walk. It turned out that the doctor, who lives
with us, was going to visit a patient in the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the soldier's wife had come from, and another
patient in the village where the District Police
Station is situated, so I joined him, and we drove
off together.</p>

<p>I went into the Police Station, while the doctor
attended to his business in that village.</p>

<p>The District Elder was not in, nor the clerk,
but only the clerk's assistant&mdash;a clever lad whom I
knew. I asked him about the woman's husband,
and why, being the only man in the family, he
had been taken as a conscript.</p>

<p>The clerk's assistant looked up the particulars,
and replied that the woman's husband was not the
only man in the family: he had a brother.</p>

<p>"Then why did she say he was the only
one?"</p>

<p>"She lied! They always do," replied he, with
a smile.</p>

<p>I made some inquiries about other matters I
had to attend to, and then the doctor returned
from visiting his patient, and we drove towards
the village in which the soldier's wife lived. But
before we were out of the first village, a girl of
about twelve came quickly across the road towards
us.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're wanted?" I said to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"No, it's your Honour I want," said the girl
to me.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I've come to your Honour, as mother is dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and we are left orphans&mdash;five of us. Help us!...
Think of our needs!"</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>The girl pointed to a brick house, not badly
built.</p>

<p>"From here ... that is our house. Come and
see for yourself!"</p>

<p>I got out of the sledge, and went towards the
house. A woman came out and asked me in.
She was the orphans' aunt. I entered a large,
clean room; all the children were there, four of
them: besides the eldest girl&mdash;two boys, a girl,
and another boy of about two. Their aunt told
me all about the family's circumstances. Two
years ago the father had been killed in a mine.
The widow tried to get compensation, but failed.
She was left with four children; the fifth was
born after her husband's death. She struggled on
alone as best she could, hiring a labourer at first
to work her land. But without her husband
things went worse and worse. First they had to
sell their cow, then the horse, and at last only
two sheep were left. Still they managed to live
somehow; but two months ago the woman herself
fell ill and died, leaving five children, the
eldest twelve years old.</p>

<p>"They must get along as best they can. I try
to help them, but can't do much. I can't think
what's to become of them! I wish they'd die!...
If one could only get them into some Orphanage&mdash;or
at least some of them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The eldest girl evidently understood and took
in the whole of my conversation with her aunt.</p>

<p>"If at least one could get little Nicky placed
somewhere! It's awful; one can't leave him for
a moment," said she, pointing to the sturdy little
two-year old urchin, who with his little sister was
merrily laughing at something or other, and evidently
did not at all share his aunt's wish.</p>

<p>I promised to take steps to get one or more of
the children into an Orphanage. The eldest girl
thanked me, and asked when she should come for
an answer. The eyes of all the children, even of
Nicky, were fixed on me, as on some fairy being
capable of doing anything for them.</p>

<p>Before I had reached the sledge, after leaving
the house, I met an old man. He bowed, and at
once began speaking about these same orphans.</p>

<p>"What misery!" he said; "it's pitiful to see
them. And the eldest little girlie, how she looks
after them&mdash;just like a mother! Wonderful how
the Lord helps her! It's a mercy the neighbours
don't forsake them, or they'd simply die of
hunger, the dear little things!... They are the
sort of people it does no harm to help," he added,
evidently advising me to do so.</p>

<p>I took leave of the old man, the aunt, and the
little girl, and drove with the doctor to the woman
who had been to see me that morning.</p>

<p>At the first house we came to, I inquired
where she lived. It happened to be the house
of a widow I know very well; she lives on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
alms she begs, and she has a particularly importunate
and pertinacious way of extorting them.
As usual, she at once began to beg. She said she
was just now in special need of help to enable
her to rear a calf.</p>

<p>"She's eating me and the old woman out of
house and home. Come in and see her."</p>

<p>"And how is the old woman?"</p>

<p>"What about the old woman?... She's
hanging on...."</p>

<p>I promised to come and see, not so much the
calf as the old woman, and again inquired where
the soldier's wife lived. The widow pointed to
the next hut but one, and hastened to add that
no doubt they were poor, but her brother-in-law
"does drink dreadfully!"</p>

<p>Following her instructions, I went to the next
house but one.</p>

<p>Miserable as are the huts of all the poor in
our villages, it is long since I saw one so dilapidated
as that. Not only the whole roof, but the
walls were so crooked that the windows were
aslant.</p>

<p>Inside, it was no better than outside. The
brick oven took up one-third of the black, dirty
little hut, which to my surprise was full of people.
I thought I should find the widow alone with
her children; but here was a sister-in-law (a
young woman with children) and an old mother-in-law.
The soldier's wife herself had just returned
from her visit to me, and was warming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
herself on the top of the oven. While she was
getting down, her mother-in-law began telling me
of their life. Her two sons had lived together
at first, and they all managed to feed themselves.</p>

<p>"But who remain together nowadays? All
separate," the garrulous old woman went on.
"The wives began quarrelling, so the brothers
separated, and life became still harder. We had
little land, and only managed to live by their
wage-labour; and now they have taken Peter as a
soldier! So where is she to turn to with her
children? She's living with us now, but we
can't manage to feed them all! We can't think
what we are to do. They say he may be got
back."</p>

<p>The soldier's wife, having climbed down from
the oven, continued to implore me to take steps
to get her husband back. I told her it was impossible,
and asked what property her husband
had left behind with his brother, to keep her and
the children. There was none. He had handed
over his land to his brother, that he might feed
her and the children. They had had three sheep;
but two had been sold to pay the expenses of
getting her husband off, and there was only some
old rubbish left, she said, besides a sheep and two
fowls. That was all she had. Her mother-in-law
confirmed her words.</p>

<p>I asked the soldier's wife where she had come
from. She came from Sergíevskoe. Sergíevskoe
is a large, well-to-do village some thirty miles off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
I asked if her parents were alive. She said they
were alive, and living comfortably.</p>

<p>"Why should you not go to them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I thought of that myself, but am afraid they
won't have the four of us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will. Why not write to them?
Shall I write for you?"</p>

<p>The woman agreed, and I noted down her
parents' address.</p>

<p>While I was talking to the woman, the eldest
child&mdash;a fat-bellied girl&mdash;came up to her mother,
and, pulling at her sleeve, began asking for something,
probably food. The woman went on talking
to me, and paid no attention to the girl, who
again pulled and muttered something.</p>

<p>"There's no getting rid of you!" exclaimed
the woman, and with a swing of her arm struck
her on the head. The girl burst into a howl.</p>

<p>Having finished my business there, I left the
hut and went back to the widow.</p>

<p>She was outside her house, waiting for me, and
again asked me to come and look at her calf. I
went in, and in the passage there really was a calf.
The widow asked me to look at it. I did so, feeling
that she was so engrossed in her calf that she
could not imagine that anyone could help being
interested in seeing it.</p>

<p>Having looked at the calf, I stepped inside, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is the old woman?"</p>

<p>"The old woman?" the widow repeated, evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>dently
surprised that after having seen the calf, I
could still be interested in the old woman. "Why,
on the top of the oven! Where else should she
be?"</p>

<p>I went up to the oven, and greeted the old
woman.</p>

<p>"Oh! ... oh!" answered a hoarse, feeble
voice. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>I told her, and asked how she was getting on.</p>

<p>"What's my life worth?"</p>

<p>"Are you in pain?"</p>

<p>"Everything aches! Oh! ... oh!"</p>

<p>"The doctor is here with me; shall I call him in?"</p>

<p>"Doctor!... Oh! ... oh! What do I
want with your doctor?... My doctor is up
there.... Oh! ... oh!"</p>

<p>"She's old, you know," said the widow.</p>

<p>"Not older than I am," replied I.</p>

<p>"Not older? Much older! People say she is
ninety," said the widow. "All her hair has come
out. I cut it all off the other day."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Why, it had nearly all come out, so I cut it
off!"</p>

<p>"Oh! ... oh!" moaned the old woman;
"oh! God has forgotten me! He does not take
my soul. If the Lord won't take it, it can't go of
itself! Oh! ... oh! It must be for my sins! ...
I've nothing to moisten my throat....
If only I had a drop of tea to drink before I die....
Oh! ... oh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor entered the hut, and I said goodbye
and went out into the street.</p>

<p>We got into the sledge, and drove to a small
neighbouring village to see the doctor's last
patient, who had sent for him the day before.
We went into the hut together.</p>

<p>The room was small, but clean; in the middle
of it a cradle hung from the ceiling, and a woman
stood rocking it energetically. At the table sat a
girl of about eight, who gazed at us with surprised
and frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" the doctor asked.</p>

<p>"On the oven," replied the woman, not ceasing
to rock the cradle.</p>

<p>The doctor climbed up, and, leaning over the
patient, did something to him.</p>

<p>I drew nearer, and asked about the sick man's
condition.</p>

<p>The doctor gave me no answer. I climbed up,
too, and gazing through the darkness gradually
began to discern the hairy head of the man on the
oven-top. Heavy, stifling air hung about the
sick man, who lay on his back. The doctor was
holding his left hand to feel the pulse.</p>

<p>"Is he very bad?" I asked.</p>

<p>Without answering me, the doctor turned to
the woman.</p>

<p>"Light a lamp," he said.</p>

<p>She called the girl, told her to rock the cradle,
and went and lit a lamp and handed it to the
doctor. I got down, so as not to be in his way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He took the lamp, and continued to examine the
patient.</p>

<p>The little girl, staring at us, did not rock the
cradle strongly enough, and the baby began to cry
piercingly and piteously. The mother, having
handed the lamp to the doctor, pushed the girl
angrily aside and again began to rock the cradle.</p>

<p>I returned to the doctor, and again asked how
the patient was. The doctor, still occupied with
the patient, softly whispered one word.</p>

<p>I did not hear, and asked again.</p>

<p>"The death-agony," he repeated, purposely
using a non-Russian word, and got down and
placed the lamp on the table.</p>

<p>The baby did not cease crying in a piteous and
angry voice.</p>

<p>"What's that? Is he dead?" said the woman,
as if she had understood the foreign word the doctor
had used.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but there is no hope!" replied he.</p>

<p>"Then I must send for the priest," said the
woman in a dissatisfied voice, rocking the screaming
baby more and more violently.</p>

<p>"If only my husband was at home!... But
now, who can I send? They've all gone to the
forest for firewood."</p>

<p>"I can do nothing more here," said the doctor;
and we went away.</p>

<p>I heard afterwards that the woman found someone
to send for the priest, who had just time to
administer the Sacrament to the dying man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>We drove home in silence, both, I think, experiencing
the same feeling.</p>

<p>"What was the matter with him?" I asked at
length.</p>

<p>"Inflammation of the lungs. I did not expect
it to end so quickly. He had a very strong constitution,
but the conditions were deadly. With
105 degrees of fever, he went and sat outside the
hut, where there were only 20 degrees."</p>

<p>Again we drove on in silence for a long time.</p>

<p>"I noticed no bedding or pillow on the oven,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" replied the doctor. And, evidently
knowing what I was thinking about, he
went on:</p>

<p>"Yesterday I was at Kroutoe to see a woman
who has had a baby. To examine her properly,
as was necessary, she should have been placed so
that she could lie stretched out full length; but
there was no place in the whole hut where that
could be done."</p>

<p>Again we were silent, and again we probably
both had the same thoughts. We reached home
in silence. At the porch stood a fine pair of horses,
harnessed tandem to a carpet-upholstered sledge.
The handsome coachman was dressed in a sheepskin
coat, and wore a thick fur cap. They belonged to
my son, who had driven over from his estate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here we are sitting at the dinner-table, laid
for ten persons. One of the places is empty. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is my little granddaughter's. She is not quite
well to-day, and is having her dinner in her room
with her nurse. A specially hygienic dinner has
been prepared for her: beef-tea and sago.</p>

<p>At our big dinner of four courses, with two
kinds of wine, served by two footmen, and eaten
at a table decorated with flowers, this is the kind
of talk that goes on:</p>

<p>"Where do these splendid roses come from?"
asks my son.</p>

<p>My wife tells him that a lady, who will not
divulge her name, sends them from Petersburg.</p>

<p>"Roses like these cost three shillings each,"
says my son, and goes on to relate how at some
concert or play such roses were showered on a
performer till they covered the stage. The conversation
passes on to music, and then to a man
who is a very good judge and patron of music.</p>

<p>"By the by, how is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is always ailing. He is again going to
Italy. He always spends the winter there, and
his health improves wonderfully."</p>

<p>"But the journey is very trying and tedious."</p>

<p>"Oh no! Not if one takes the express&mdash;it is
only thirty-nine hours."</p>

<p>"All the same, it is very dull."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit! We shall fly before long!"</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3 id="third"><i>THIRD DAY</i><br />
TAXES</h3>

<p>Besides my ordinary visitors and applicants,
there are to-day some special ones. The first
is a childless old peasant who is ending his
life in great poverty. The second is a poor woman
with a crowd of children. The third is, I believe,
a well-to-do peasant.</p>

<p>All three have come from our village, and all
have come about the same business. The taxes
are being collected before the New Year, and the
old man's samovár, the woman's only sheep, and one
of the well-to-do peasant's cows, have been noted
down for seizure in case of non-payment. They
all ask me to defend them or assist them, or to
do both.</p>

<p>The well-to-do peasant, a tall, handsome, elderly
man, is the first to speak. He tells me that the
Village Elder came, noted down the cow, and
demands twenty-seven roubles. This levy is for
the obligatory Grain Reserve Fund, and ought
not, the peasant thinks, to be collected at this time
of year. I know nothing about it, and tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that I will inquire in the District Government
Office, and will let him know whether the payment
of the tax can be postponed or not.</p>

<p>The second to speak is the old man whose
samovár has been noted. The small, thin, weakly,
poorly clad man relates, with pathetic grief and
bewilderment, how they came, took his samovár,
and demanded three roubles and seventy copecks
of him, which he has not got and can't get.</p>

<p>I ask him what the tax is for.</p>

<p>"Some kind of Government tax.... Who can
tell what it is? Where am I and my old woman
to get the money? As it is, we hardly manage to
live!... What kind of laws are these? Have
pity on our old age, and help us somehow!"</p>

<p>I promise to inquire, and to do what I can, and
I turn to the woman. She is thin and worn-out.
I know her, and know that her husband is a drunkard,
and that she has five children.</p>

<p>"They have seized my sheep! They come and
say: 'Pay the money!' 'My husband is away,
working,' I say. 'Pay up!' say they. But
where am I to find it? I only had one sheep, and
they are taking it!" And she begins to cry.</p>

<p>I promise to find out, and to help her if I can.
First, I go to the Village Elder, to find out what
the taxes are, and why they are collecting them so
rigorously.</p>

<p>In the village street, two other petitioners stop
me. Their husbands are away at work. One asks
me to buy some of her home-woven linen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
offers it for two roubles. "Because they have
seized my hens! I had just reared them, and live
by selling the eggs. Do buy it; it is good linen!
I would not let it go for three roubles if I were
not in great need!"</p>

<p>I send her away, promising to consider matters
when I return&mdash;perhaps I may be able to arrange
about the tax.</p>

<p>Before I reach the Elder's house, a woman
comes to meet me: a quick-eyed, black-eyed ex-pupil
of mine&mdash;Ólga, now already an old woman.
She is in the same plight: they have seized her
calf.</p>

<p>I come to the Elder. He is a strong, intelligent-looking
peasant, with a grizzly beard. He comes
out into the street to me. I ask him what taxes
are being collected, and why so rigorously. He
replies that he has had very strict orders to get in
all arrears before the New Year.</p>

<p>"Have you had orders to confiscate samovárs
and cattle?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" replies the Village Elder, shrugging
his shoulders. "The taxes must be paid....
Take Abakoúmof now, for instance," said he, referring
to the well-to-do peasant whose cow had
been taken in payment of some Grain Reserve
Fund. "His son is an isvóstchik: they have
three horses. Why shouldn't he pay? He's
always trying to get out of it."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose it so in his case," say I; "but
how about those who are really poor?" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I name the old man whose samovár they are
taking.</p>

<p>"Yes; they really are poor, and have nothing
to pay with. But just as if such things get considered
up there!"</p>

<p>I name the woman whose sheep was taken.
The Elder is sorry for her too, but, as if excusing
himself, explains that he must obey orders.</p>

<p>I inquire how long he has been an Elder, and
what pay he gets.</p>

<p>"How much do I get?" he says, replying not
to the question I ask, but to the question in my
mind, which he guesses namely, why he takes
part in such proceedings. "Well, I do want to
resign! We get thirty roubles a month, but are
obliged to do things that are wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, and will they really confiscate the samovárs
and sheep and fowls?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Why, of course! We are bound to take
them, and the District Government will arrange
for their sale."</p>

<p>"And will the things be sold?"</p>

<p>"The folk will manage to pay up somehow."</p>

<p>I go to the woman who came to me about her
sheep. Her hut is tiny, and in the passage outside
is her only sheep, which is to go to support
the Imperial Budget. Seeing me, she, a nervous
woman worn out by want and overwork, begins
to talk excitedly and rapidly, as peasant women do.</p>

<p>"See how I live! They're taking my last
sheep, and I myself and these brats are barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
alive!" She points up at the bunks and the oven-top,
where her children are. "Come down!...
Now then, don't be frightened!... There now,
how's one to keep oneself and them naked brats?"</p>

<p>The brats, almost literally naked, with nothing
on but tattered shirts&mdash;not even any trousers&mdash;climb
down from the oven and surround their
mother.</p>

<p>The same day I go to the District Office, to
make inquiries about this way of exacting taxation,
which is new to me.</p>

<p>The District Elder is not in. He will be back
soon. In the Office several persons are standing
behind the grating, also waiting to see him.</p>

<p>I ask them who they are, and what they have
come about. Two of them have come to get
passports, in order to be able to go out to work
at a distance. They have brought money to pay
for the passports. Another has come to get a copy
of the District Court's decision rejecting his
petition that the homestead&mdash;where he has lived
and worked for twenty-three years, and which has
belonged to his uncle, who adopted him,&mdash;now that
his uncle and aunt are dead, should not be taken
from him by his uncle's granddaughter. She,
being the direct heiress, and taking advantage of
the law of the 9th November, is selling the freehold
of the land and homestead on which the petitioner
lived. His petition has been rejected, but he cannot
believe that this is the law, and wants to appeal
to some higher Court&mdash;though he does not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
what Court. I explain that there is such a law,
and this provokes disapproval, amounting to perplexity
and incredulity, among all those who are
present.</p>

<p>Hardly have I finished talking with this man,
when a tall peasant with a stern, severe face asks
me for an explanation of his affairs. The business
he has come about is this: he and his fellow
villagers have, from time immemorial, been getting
iron ore from their land; and now a decree has
been published prohibiting this. "Not dig on
one's own land? What laws are these? We
only live by digging the iron! We have been
trying for more than a month, and can't get anything
settled. We don't know what to think of
it; they'll ruin us completely, and that will be the
end of the matter!"</p>

<p>I can say nothing comforting to this man, and
turn to the Elder&mdash;who has just come back&mdash;to
inquire about the vigorous measures which are
being taken to exact payment of arrears of taxation
in our village. I ask under what clauses of the
Act the taxes are being levied. The Elder tells
me that there are seven different kinds of rates and
taxes, the arrears of all of which are now being
collected from the peasants: (1)&nbsp;the Imperial
Taxes, (2)&nbsp;the Local Government Taxes, (3)&nbsp;the
Insurance Taxes, (4)&nbsp;the arrears of Former Grain
Reserve Funds, (5)&nbsp;New Grain Reserve Funds
in lieu of contributions in kind, (6)&nbsp;Communal
and District Taxes, and (7)&nbsp;Village Taxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The District Elder tells me, as the Village Elder
had done, that the taxes were being collected with
special rigour by order of the higher authorities.
He admits that it is no easy task to collect the
taxes from the poor, but he shows less sympathy
than the Village Elder did. He does not venture
to censure the authorities; and, above all, he has
hardly any doubt of the usefulness of his office, or
of the rightness of taking part in such activity.</p>

<p>"One can't, after all, encourage...."</p>

<p>Soon after, I had occasion to talk about these
things with a Zémsky Natchálnik.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He had very
little compassion for the hard lot of the poverty-stricken
folk whom he scarcely ever saw, and just
as little doubt of the morality and lawfulness of his
activity. In his conversation with me he admitted
that, on the whole, it would be pleasanter not to
serve at all; but he considered himself a useful
functionary, because other men in his place would
do even worse things. "And once one is living
in the country, why not take the salary, small as
it is, of a Zémsky Natchálnik?"</p>

<p>The views of a Governor on the collection of
taxes necessary to meet the needs of those who are
occupied in arranging for the nation's welfare, were
entirely free from any considerations as to samovárs,
sheep, homespun linen, or calves taken from the
poorest inhabitants of the villages; and he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
not the slightest doubt as to the usefulness of his
activity.</p>

<p>And finally, the Ministers and those who are
busy managing the liquor traffic, those who are
occupied in teaching men to kill one another, and
those who are engaged in condemning people to
exile, to prison, to penal servitude, or to the
gallows&mdash;all the Ministers and their assistants are
quite convinced that samovárs and sheep and linen
and calves taken from beggars, are put to their
best use in producing vódka (which poisons the
people), weapons for killing men, the erection of
gaols and lock-ups, and, among other things, in
paying to them and to their assistants the salaries
they require to furnish drawing-rooms, to buy
dresses for their wives, and for journeys and
amusements which they undertake as relaxations
after fulfilling their arduous labours for the welfare
of the coarse and ungrateful masses.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion"><i>CONCLUSION</i><br />
A DREAM</h3>

<p>A few nights ago I dreamt so significant a
dream that several times during the following
day I asked myself, "What has happened
to-day that is so specially important?" And then
I remembered that the specially important thing
was what I had seen, or rather heard, in my dream.</p>

<p>It was a speech that struck me greatly, spoken
by one who, as often happens in dreams, was a
combination of two men: my old friend, now
dead, Vladímir Orlóf, with grey curls on each side
of his bald head, and Nicholas Andréyevitch, a
copyist who lived with my brother.</p>

<p>The speech was evoked by the conversation of
a rich lady, the hostess, with a landowner who was
visiting her house. The lady had recounted how
the peasants on a neighbouring estate had burnt
the landlord's house and several sheds which
sheltered century-old cherry trees and duchesse
pears. Her visitor, the landowner, related how
the peasants had cut down some oaks in his forest,
and had even carted away a stack of hay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither arson nor robbery is considered a
crime nowadays. The immorality of our people
is terrible: they have all become thieves!" said
someone.</p>

<p>And in answer to those words, that man, combined
of two, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"The peasants have stolen oaks and hay, and
are thieves, and the most immoral class," he began,
addressing no one in particular. "Now, in the
Caucasus, a chieftain used to raid the Aouls and
carry off all the horses of the inhabitants. But
one of them found means to get back from the
chieftain's herds at least one of the horses that had
been stolen from him. Was that man a thief,
because he got back one of the many horses stolen
from him? And is it not the same with the trees,
the grass, the hay, and all the rest of the things
you say the peasants have stolen from you? The
earth is the Lord's, and common to all; and if the
peasants have taken what was grown on the
common land of which they have been deprived,
they have not stolen, but have only resumed
possession of a small part of what has been stolen
from them.</p>

<p>"I know you consider land to be the property
of the landlord, and therefore call the restoration
to themselves of its produce by the peasants&mdash;robbery;
but, you know, that is not true! The
land never was, and never can be, anyone's
property. If a man has more of it than he requires,
while others have none, then he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
possesses the surplus land possesses not land but
men; and men cannot be the property of other men.</p>

<p>"Because a dozen mischievous lads have burnt
some cherry tree sheds, and have cut down some
trees, you say the peasants are thieves, and the
most immoral class!...</p>

<p>"How can your tongue frame such words!
They have stolen ten oaks from you. Stolen!
'To prison with them!'</p>

<p>"Why, if they had taken not your oaks alone
but everything that is in this house, they would
only have taken what is theirs: made by them
and their brothers, but certainly not by you!
'Stolen oaks!' But for ages you have been
stealing from them, not oaks but their lives, and
the lives of their children, their womenfolk and
their old men&mdash;who withered away before their
time&mdash;only because they were deprived of the land
God gave to them in common with all men, and
they were obliged to work for you.</p>

<p>"Only think of the life those millions of men
have lived and are living, and of how you live!
Only consider what they do, supplying you with
all the comforts of life, and of what you do for
them, depriving them of everything&mdash;even of the
possibility of supporting themselves and their
families! All you live on&mdash;everything in this
room, everything in this house, and in all your
splendid cities, all your palaces, all your mad,
literally mad, luxuries&mdash;has been made, and is
still continually being made, by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"And they know this. They know that these
parks of yours, and your race-horses, motor cars,
palaces, dainty dishes and finery, and all the nastiness
and stupidity you call 'science' and 'art'&mdash;are
purchased with the lives of their brothers
and sisters. They know and cannot help knowing
this. Then think what feelings these people
would have towards you, if they were like you!</p>

<p>"One would suppose that, knowing all you
inflict on them, they could not but hate you from
the bottom of their souls, and could not help
wishing to revenge themselves on you. And you
know there are tens of millions of them, and only
some thousands of you. But what do they
do?... Why, instead of crushing you as useless
and harmful reptiles, they continue to repay
your evil with good, and live their laborious and
reasonable, though hard life, patiently biding the
day when you will become conscious of your sin
and will amend your ways. But instead of that,
what do you do? From the height of your
refined, self-confident immorality, you deign to
stoop to those 'depraved, coarse people.' You
enlighten them, and play the benefactor to them;
that is to say, with the means supplied to you by
their labour, you inoculate them with your
depravity, and blame, correct, and best of all
'punish' them, as unreasoning or vicious infants
bite the breasts that feed them.</p>

<p>"Yes, look at yourselves, and consider what you
are and what they are! Realise that they alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
live, while you, with your Doúmas, Ministries,
Synods, Academies, Universities, Conservatoires,
Law Courts, armies, and all such stupidities and
nastinesses, are but playing at life, and spoiling it
for yourselves and others. They, the people, are
alive. They are the tree, and you are harmful
growths&mdash;fungi on the plant. Realise, then, all
your insignificance and their grandeur! Understand
your sin, and try to repent, and at all costs
set the people free...."</p>

<p>"How well he speaks!" thought I. "Can it
be a dream?"</p>

<p>And as I thought that, I awoke.</p>

<p>This dream set me again thinking about the
land question: a question of which those who
live constantly in the country, among a poverty-stricken
agricultural peasant population, cannot
help thinking. I know I have often written
about it; but under the influence of that dream,
even at the risk of repeating myself, I once more
felt the need to express myself. <i>Carthago delenda
est.</i> As long as people's attitude towards private
property in land remains unchanged, the cruelty,
madness and evil of this form of the enslavement
of some men by others, cannot be pointed out too
frequently.</p>

<p>People say that land is property, and they say
this because the Government recognises private
property in land. But fifty years ago the Government
upheld private property in human beings;
yet a time came when it was admitted that human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beings cannot be private property, and the Government
ceased to hold them to be property. So it
will be with property in land. The Government
now upholds that property, and protects it by its
power; but a day will come when the Government
will cease to acknowledge this kind of
property, and will abolish it. The Government
will have to abolish it, because private property
in land is just such an injustice as property in
men&mdash;serfdom&mdash;used to be. The difference lies
only in the fact that serfdom was a direct, definite
slavery, while land-slavery is indirect and indefinite.
Then Peter was John's slave, whereas
now Peter is the slave of some person unknown,
but certainly of him who owns the land Peter
requires in order to feed himself and his family.
And not only is land-slavery as unjust and
cruel a slavery as serfdom used to be, it is even
harder on the slaves, and more criminal on the
part of the slave-holders. For under serfdom&mdash;if
not from sympathy, then at least from self-interest&mdash;the
owner was obliged to see to it that
his serf did not wither away and die of want,
but to the best of his ability and understanding
he looked after his slaves' morality. Now the
landowner cares nothing if his landless slave
withers away or becomes demoralised; for he
knows that however many men die or become
depraved at his work, he will always be able to
find workmen.</p>

<p>The injustice and cruelty of the new, present-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
slavery&mdash;land-slavery&mdash;is so evident, and the
condition of the slaves is everywhere so hard,
that one would have expected this new slavery to
have been recognised by this time as out of date,
just as serfdom was admittedly out of date half
a century ago; and it should, one would have
thought, have been abolished, as serfdom was
abolished.</p>

<p>"But," it is said, "property in land cannot be
abolished, for it would be impossible to divide
equally among all the labourers and non-labourers
the advantages given by land of different qualities."</p>

<p>But that is not true. To abolish property in
land, no distribution of land is necessary.</p>

<p>Just as, when serfdom was abolished, no distribution
of the people liberated was necessary,
but all that was needed was the abolition of the
law that upheld serfdom, so with the abolition of
private property in land: no distribution of land
is needed, but only the abolition of the law
sanctioning private property in land. And as
when serfdom was abolished, the serfs of their
own accord settled down as best suited them, so
when private property in land is abolished, people
will find a way of sharing the land among themselves
so that all may have equal advantage from
it. How this will be arranged, whether by Henry
George's Single-Tax system, or in some other
way, we cannot foresee. But it is certain that the
Government need only cease to uphold by force
the obviously unjust and oppressive rights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
property in land, and the people, released from
those restrictions, will always find means of apportioning
the land by common consent, in such a
way that everyone will have an equal share of
the benefits the use of the land confers.</p>

<p>It is only necessary for the majority of land-owners&mdash;that
is, slave-owners&mdash;to understand (as
they did in the matter of serfdom) that property
in land is as hard on the present-day slaves, and
as great an iniquity on the part of the slave-owners,
as serfdom was; and, having understood that, it
is only necessary for them to impress on the
Government the necessity of repealing the laws
sanctioning property in land&mdash;that is, land-slavery.
One would have thought that, as in the 'fifties, the
best members of society (chiefly the serf-owning
nobles themselves), having understood the criminality
of their position, explained to the Government
the necessity for abolishing their evidently
out-of-date and immoral rights, and serfdom was
abolished, so it should be now with regard to
private property in land, which is land-slavery.</p>

<p>But strange to say, the present slave-owners,
the landed proprietors, not only fail to see the
criminality of their position, and do not impress
on the Government the necessity of abolishing
land-slavery, but on the contrary they consciously
and unconsciously, by all manner of means, blind
themselves and their slaves to the criminality of
their position.</p>

<p>The reasons of this are: first, that serfdom in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the 'fifties, being the plain, downright enslavement
of man by man, ran too clearly counter to religious
and moral feeling; while land-slavery is not a
direct, immediate slavery, but is a form of slavery
more hidden from the slaves, and especially from
the slave-owners, by complicated governmental,
social and economic institutions. And the second
reason is that, while in the days of serfdom only
one class were slave-owners, all classes, except the
most numerous one&mdash;consisting of peasants who
have too little land: labourers and working men&mdash;are
slave-owners now. Nowadays nobles, merchants,
officials, manufacturers, professors, teachers,
authors, musicians, painters, rich peasants, rich
men's servants, well-paid artisans, electricians,
mechanics, etc., are all slave-owners of the peasants
who have insufficient land, and of the unskilled
workmen who&mdash;apparently as a result of most
varied causes, but in reality as a result of one
cause alone (the appropriation of land by the
landed proprietors)&mdash;are obliged to give their
labour and even their lives to those who possess
the advantages land affords. These two reasons&mdash;that
the new slavery is less evident than the old,
and that the new slave-owners are much more
numerous than the old ones&mdash;account for the fact
that the slave-owners of our day do not see, and do
not admit, the cruelty and criminality of their position,
and do not free themselves from it.</p>

<p>The slave-owners of our day not only do not
admit that their position is criminal, and do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
try to escape from it, but are quite sure that property
in land is a necessary institution, essential to
the social order, and that the wretched condition
of the working classes&mdash;which they cannot help
noticing&mdash;results from most varied causes, but
certainly not from the recognition of some people's
right to own land as private property.</p>

<p>This opinion of land-owning, and of the causes
of the wretched condition of the labourers, is so
well established in all the leading countries of
the Christian world&mdash;France, England, Germany,
America, etc.&mdash;that with very rare exceptions it
never occurs to their public men to look in the
right direction for the cause of the wretched condition
of the workers.</p>

<p>That is so in Europe and America; but one
would have expected that for us Russians, with
our hundred million peasant population who deny
the principle of private ownership in land, and
with our enormous tracts of land, and with the
almost religious desire of our people for agricultural
life, an answer very different to the general
European answer to questions as to the causes of
the distress among the workers, and as to the
means of bettering their position, would naturally
present itself.</p>

<p>One would think that we Russians might understand
that if we really are concerned about, and
desire to improve, the position of the people and
to free them from the aggravating and demoralising
fetters with which they are bound, the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to do this are indicated both by common-sense
and by the voice of the people, and are simply&mdash;the
abolition of private property in land, that is to
say, the abolition of land-slavery.</p>

<p>But, strange to relate, in Russian society, occupied
with questions of the improvement of the
condition or the working classes, there is no
suggestion of this one, natural, simple and self-evident
means of improving their condition. We
Russians, though our peasants' outlook on the
land question is probably centuries ahead of the
rest of Europe, can devise nothing better for the
improvement of our people's condition than to
establish among ourselves, on the European model,
Doúmas, Councils, Ministries, Courts, Zémstvos,
Universities, Extension Lectures, Academies, elementary
schools, fleets, sub-marines, air-ships, and
many other of the queerest things quite foreign to
and unnecessary for the people, and we do not
do the one thing that is demanded by religion,
morality, and common-sense, as well as by the
whole of the peasantry.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. While arranging the fate of
our people, who do not and never did acknowledge
land-ownership, we, imitating Europe, try in all
sorts of cunning ways, and by deception, bribery,
and even force, to accustom them to the idea of
property in land&mdash;that is to say, we try to deprave
them and to destroy their consciousness of the
truth they have held for ages, and which sooner
or later will certainly be acknowledged by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
whole human race: the truth that all who live
on the earth cannot but have an equal right to its
use.</p>

<p>These efforts to inoculate the people with the
idea of landed property that is so foreign to them,
are unceasingly made, with great perseverance and
zeal by the Government, and consciously or for the
most part unconsciously, from an instinct of self-preservation,
by all the slave-holders of our time.
And the slave-holders of our time are not the land-owners
alone, but are all those who, as a result of
the people being deprived of the land, enjoy power
over them.</p>

<p>Most strenuous efforts are made to deprave the
people; but, thank God! it may be safely said that
till now all those efforts have only had an effect on
the smallest and worst part of Russia's peasant
population. The many-millioned majority of
Russian workmen who hold but little land and
live&mdash;not the depraved, parasitic life of the slave-owners,
but their own reasonable, hard-working
lives&mdash;do not yield to those efforts; because for
them the solution of the land question is not one
of personal advantage, as it is regarded by all the
different slave-owners of to-day. For the enormous
majority of peasants, the solution of that problem is
not arrived at by mutually contradictory economic
theories that spring up to-day and to-morrow are
forgotten, but is found in the one truth, which is
realised by them, and always has been and is
realised by all reasonable men the world over,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>the
truth that all men are brothers and have therefore
all an equal right to all the blessings of the
world and, among the rest, to the most necessary
of all rights&mdash;namely, the equal right of all to the
use of the land.</p>

<p>Living in this truth, an enormous majority of
the peasants attach no importance to all the wretched
measures adopted by the Government about this
or that alteration of the laws of land-ownership, for
they know that there is only one solution to the
land question&mdash;the total abolition of private property
in land, and of land-slavery. And, knowing this,
they quietly await their day, which sooner or later
must come.</p>

<h2 id="singing">SINGING IN THE VILLAGE</h2>


<p>Voices and an accordion sounded as if close
by, though through the mist nobody could
be seen. It was a work-day morning, and I
was surprised to hear music.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the recruits' leave-taking," thought I,
remembering that I had heard something a few
days before about five men being drawn from
our village. Involuntarily attracted by the merry
song, I went in the direction whence it proceeded.</p>

<p>As I approached the singers, the sound of song
and accordion suddenly stopped. The singers,
that is the lads who were leave-taking, entered
the double-fronted brick cottage belonging to the
father of one of them. Before the door stood a
small group of women, girls, and children.</p>

<p>While I was finding out whose sons were going,
and why they had entered that cottage, the lads
themselves, accompanied by their mothers and
sisters, came out at the door. There were five of
them: four bachelors and one married man. Our
village is near the town where nearly all these conscripts
had worked. They were dressed town-fashion,
evidently wearing their best clothes: pea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>jackets,
new caps, and high, showy boots. Conspicuous
among them was a young fellow, well
built though not tall, with a sweet, merry, expressive
face, a small beard and moustache just
beginning to sprout, and bright hazel eyes. As
he came out, he at once took a big, expensive-looking
accordion that was hanging over his
shoulders and, having bowed to me, started playing
the merry tune of "Bárynya," running his
fingers nimbly over the keys and keeping exact
time, as he moved with rhythmic step jauntily down
the road.</p>

<p>Beside him walked a thick-set, fair-haired lad,
also of medium height. He looked gaily from
side to side, and sang second with spirit, in
harmony with the first singer. He was the
married one. These two walked ahead of the
other three, who were also well dressed, and not
remarkable in any way except that one of them
was tall.</p>

<p>Together with the crowd I followed the lads.
All their songs were merry, and no expression of
grief was heard while the procession was going
along; but as soon as we came to the next house
at which the lads were to be treated, the lamentations
of the women began. It was difficult to
make out what they were saying; only a word
here and there could be distinguished: "death
... father and mother ... native land ...";
and after every verse, the woman who led the
chanting took a deep breath, and burst out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
long-drawn moans, followed by hysterical laughter.
The women were the mothers and sisters of the
conscripts. Beside the lamentations of these
relatives, one heard the admonitions of their
friends.</p>

<p>"Now then, Matryóna, that's enough! You
must be tired out," I heard one woman say, consoling
another who was lamenting.</p>

<p>The lads entered the cottage. I remained outside,
talking with a peasant acquaintance, Vasíly
Oréhof, a former pupil of mine. His son, one of
the five, was the married man who had been singing
second as he went along.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "it is a pity!"</p>

<p>"What's to be done? Pity or not, one has to
serve."</p>

<p>And he told me of his domestic affairs. He
had three sons: the eldest was living at home,
the second was now being taken, and a third (who,
like the second, had gone away to work) was contributing
dutifully to the support of the home.
The one who was leaving had evidently not sent
home much.</p>

<p>"He has married a townswoman. His wife is
not fit for our work. He is a lopped-off branch
and thinks only of keeping himself. To be sure
it's a pity, but it can't be helped!"</p>

<p>While we were talking, the lads came out into
the street, and the lamentations, shrieks, laughter,
and adjurations recommenced. After standing
about for some five minutes, the procession moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
on with songs and accordion accompaniment. One
could not help marvelling at the energy and spirit
of the player, as he beat time accurately, stamped
his foot, stopped short, and then after a pause
again took up the melody most merrily, exactly on
the right beat, while he gazed around with his
kind, hazel eyes. Evidently he had a real and
great talent for music.</p>

<p>I looked at him, and (so at least it seemed to
me) he felt abashed when he met my eyes, and
with a twitch of his brows he turned away, and
again burst out with even more spirit than before.
When we reached the fifth and last of the cottages,
the lads entered, and I followed them. All five of
them were made to sit round a table covered with
a cloth, on which were bread and vódka. The
host, the man I had been talking to, who was now
to take leave of his married son, poured out the
vódka and handed it round. The lads hardly
drank at all (at most a quarter of a glass) or even
handed it back after just raising it to their lips.
The hostess cut some bread, and served slices
round to eat with the vódka.</p>

<p>While I was looking at the lads, a woman,
dressed in clothes that seemed to me strange and
incongruous, got down from the top of the oven,
close to where I sat. She wore a light green dress
(silk, I think) with fashionable trimmings, and
high-heeled boots. Her fair hair was arranged in
quite the modern style, like a large round cap, and
she wore big, ring-shaped, gold earrings. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
face was neither sad nor cheerful, but looked as if
she were offended.</p>

<p>After getting down, she went out into the
passage, clattering with the heels of her new boots
and paying no heed to the lads. All about this
woman&mdash;her clothing, the offended expression of
her face, and above all her earrings&mdash;was so foreign
to the surroundings that I could not understand
how she had come to be on the top of Vasíly
Oréhof's oven. I asked a woman sitting near me
who she was.</p>

<p>"Vasíly's daughter-in-law; she has been a
housemaid," was the answer.</p>

<p>The host began offering vódka a third time, but
the lads refused, rose, said grace, thanked the
hosts, and went out.</p>

<p>In the street, the lamentations recommenced at
once. The first to raise her voice was a very old
woman with a bent back. She lamented in such a
peculiarly piteous voice, and wailed so, that the
women kept soothing the sobbing, staggering old
creature, and supported her by her elbows.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, it's his granny; Vasíly's mother, that
is."</p>

<p>The old woman burst into hysterical laughter
and fell into the arms of the women who supported
her, and just then the procession started again, and
again the accordion and the merry voices struck up
their tune. At the end of the village the procession
was overtaken by the carts which were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
carry the conscripts to the District Office. The
weeping and wailing stopped. The accordion-player,
getting more and more elated, bending his
head to one side and resting on one foot, turned
out the toes of the other and stamped with it,
while his fingers produced brilliant <i>fioritures</i>, and
exactly at the right instant the bold, high, merry
tones of his song, and the second of Vasíly's son,
again chimed in. Old and young, and especially
the children who surrounded the crowd, and I
with them, fixed their eyes admiringly on the
singer.</p>

<p>"He is clever, the rascal!" said one of the
peasants.</p>

<p>"'Sorrow weeps, and sorrow sings!'" replied
another.</p>

<p>At that moment one of the young fellows whom
we were seeing off&mdash;the tall one&mdash;came up with
long, energetic strides, and stooped to speak to
the one who played the accordion.</p>

<p>"What a fine fellow," I thought; "they will
put him in the Guards." I did not know who he
was or what house he belonged to.</p>

<p>"Whose son is that one? That gallant fellow?"
I asked a little old man, pointing to the fine lad.</p>

<p>The old man raised his cap and bowed to me,
but did not hear my question.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked he.</p>

<p>I had not recognised him, but as soon as he
spoke I knew him at once. He is a hard-working,
good peasant who, as often happens, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
specially marked out for misfortune: first, two
horses were stolen from him, then his house
burnt down, and then his wife died. I had not
seen Prokófey for a long time, and remembered
him as a bright red-haired man of medium height;
whereas he was now not red, but quite grey-haired,
and small.</p>

<p>"Ah, Prokófey, it's you!" I said. "I was
asking whose son that fine fellow is&mdash;that one
who has just spoken to Alexander?"</p>

<p>"That one?" Prokófey replied, pointing with
a motion of his head to the tall lad. He shook
his head and mumbled something I did not understand.</p>

<p>"I'm asking whose son the lad is?" I repeated,
and turned to look at Prokófey.</p>

<p>His face was puckered, and his jaw trembled.</p>

<p>"He's mine!" he muttered, and, turning away
and hiding his face in his hand, began to whimper
like a child.</p>

<p>And only then, after the two words, "He's
mine!" spoken by Prokófey, did I realise, not
only in my mind but in my whole being, the
horror of what was taking place before my eyes
that memorable misty morning. All the disjointed,
incomprehensible, strange things I had
seen suddenly acquired a simple, clear, and terrible
significance. I became painfully ashamed of
having looked on as at an interesting spectacle.
I stopped, conscious of having acted ill, and I
turned to go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>And to think that these things are at the present
moment being done to tens of thousands of men
all over Russia, and have been done, and will long
continue to be done, to the meek, wise, and saintly
Russian people, who are so cruelly and treacherously
deceived!</p>

<p class="p2">PEASANT. What brings you?...</p>

<p>TRAVELLER [<i>taking off his spectacles and putting
down his book</i>]. There is no train till to-morrow.
The station is crowded, so I asked your missis to
let me stay the night with you, and she allowed it.</p>

<p>PEASANT. That's all right, you can stay.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Thank you!... Well, and how
are you living nowadays?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Living? What's our life like?...
As bad as can be!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. How's that?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Why, because we've nothing to live
on! Our life is so hard that if we wanted a worse
one, we couldn't get it.... You see, there are
nine of us in family; all want to eat, and I have
only got in four bushels of corn. Try and live
on that! Whether one likes it or not, one has
to go and work for wages ... and when you
look for a job, wages are down!... The rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
do what they like with us. The people increase,
but the land doesn't, and taxes keep piling up!
There's rent, and the district tax, and the land tax,
and the tax for bridges, and insurance, and police,
and for the corn store ... too many to count!
And there are the priests and the landlords....
They all ride on our backs, except those who are
too lazy!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. I thought the peasants were doing
well nowadays.</p>

<p>PEASANT. So well, that we go hungry for days
at a time!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. The reason I thought so, was that
they have taken to squandering so much money.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Squandering what money? How
strange you talk!... Here are people starving
to death, and you talk of squandering money!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. But how is it? The papers say
that 700 million roubles (and a million is a
thousand thousands)&mdash;700 million were spent by
the peasants on vódka last year.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Are we the only ones that drink?
Just look at the priests.... Don't they swill first-rate?
And the gentlefolk aren't behind-hand!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Still, that's only a small part.
The greater part stills falls to the peasants.</p>

<p>PEASANT. What of that? Are we not to drink
at all?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. No; what I mean is that if 700
millions were squandered on vódka in one year it
shows that life can't be so very hard.... 700<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
millions! It's no joke ... one can hardly
imagine it!</p>

<p>PEASANT. But how can one do without it?
We didn't start the custom, and it's not for us to
stop it.... There are the Church feasts, and
weddings, and memorial feasts, and bargains to be
wetted with a drink.... Whether one likes it or
not, one can't get on without it. It's the custom!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. But there are people who never
drink, and yet they manage to live! After all,
there's not much good in it.</p>

<p>PEASANT. No good at all! Only evil!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Then one ought not to drink.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Well, anyhow, drink or no drink,
we've nothing to live on! We've not enough
land. If we had land we could at least live ...
but there's none to be had.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. No land to be had? Why, isn't
there plenty of land? Wherever one looks, one
sees land!</p>

<p>PEASANT. There's land, right enough, but it's
not ours. Your elbow's not far from your mouth,
but just you try to bite it!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Not yours! Whose is it, then?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Whose?... Whose, indeed!
There's that fat-bellied devil over there ... he's
seized 5000 acres. He has no family, but he's
never satisfied, while we've had to give up keeping
fowls&mdash;there's nowhere for them to run
about! It's nearly time for us to stop keeping
cattle, too ... we've no fodder for them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
if a calf, or maybe a horse, happens to stray into
his field, we have to pay fines and give him our
last farthing.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. What does he want all that land for?</p>

<p>PEASANT. What does he want the land for?
Why, of course, he sows and reaps and sells, and
puts the money in the bank.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. How can he plough a stretch like
that, and get his harvest in?</p>

<p>PEASANT. You talk as if you were a child!...
What's he got money for, if not to hire
labourers?... It's they that do the ploughing
and reaping.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. These labourers are some of you
peasants, I expect?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Some are from these parts, and some
from elsewhere.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Anyway, they are peasants?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Of course they are!... the same
as ourselves. Who but a peasant ever works?
Of course they are peasants.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. And if the peasants did not go and
work for him...?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Go or stay, he wouldn't let us have
it. If the land were to lie idle, he'd not part with
it! Like the dog in the manger, that doesn't eat
the hay himself and won't let others eat it!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. But how can he keep his land?
I suppose it stretches over some three or four
miles? How can he watch it all?</p>

<p>PEASANT. How queer you talk! He himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lies on his back, and fattens his paunch; but he
keeps watchmen!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. And those watchmen, I dare say,
are also peasants?</p>

<p>PEASANT. What else could they be? Of course
they are!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. So that the peasants work the rich
man's land for him, and guard it for him from
themselves?</p>

<p>PEASANT. But how can one help it?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Simply by not going to work for
him, and not being his watchmen! Then the land
would be free. The land is God's, and the people
are God's; let him who needs it, plough and sow
and gather in the harvest!</p>

<p>PEASANT. That is to say, you think we ought to
strike? To meet that, my friend, they have the
soldiers. They'd send their soldiers ... one,
two, fire!... some would get shot, and others
taken up. Soldiers give short shrift!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. But is it not also the likes of you
that are soldiers? Why should they shoot at
their own fellows?</p>

<p>PEASANT. How can they help it? That's what
the oath is for.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. The oath? What oath?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Don't you understand? Aren't you
a Russian?... The oath is&mdash;well, it's the
oath!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. It means swearing, doesn't it?</p>

<p>PEASANT. Well, of course! They swear by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Cross and by the Gospels, to lay down their life
for their country.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Well, I think that should not be
done.</p>

<p>PEASANT. What should not be done?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Taking the oath.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Not done? Why, the law demands it!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. No, it is not in the Law. In the
Law of Christ, it is plainly forbidden. He said:
"Swear not at all."</p>

<p>PEASANT. Come now! What about the priests?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER [<i>takes a book, looks for the place, and
reads</i>]: "It was said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not forswear thyself, <i>but I say unto you, Swear
not at all</i>.... But let your speech be, Yea, yea;
nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of
the evil one" (Matthew v. 33). So, according to
Christ's Law, you must not swear.</p>

<p>PEASANT. If there were no oath, there would be
no soldiers.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Well, and what good are the
soldiers?</p>

<p>PEASANT. What good?... But supposing
other Tsars were to come and attack our Tsar
... what then?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. If the Tsars quarrel, let them fight
it out themselves.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Come! How could that be possible?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. It's very simple. He that believes
in God, no matter what you may tell him, will
never kill a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
PEASANT. Then why did the priest read out in
church that war was declared, and the Reserves
were to be ready?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. I know nothing about that; but I
know that in the Commandments, in the Sixth, it
says quite plainly: "Thou shalt do no murder."
You see, it is forbidden for a man to kill a man.</p>

<p>PEASANT. That means, at home! At the wars,
how could you help it? They're enemies!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. According to Christ's Gospel, there
is no such thing as an enemy. You are told to
love everybody.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Opens the Bible and looks for place.</i></p>

<p>PEASANT. Well, read it!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. "Ye have heard that it was said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever
shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment....
Ye have heard that it was said, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: but
I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for
them that persecute you" (Matthew v. 21, 43-44).</p>

<p class="right">[<i>A long pause.</i></p>

<p>PEASANT. Well, but what about taxes? Ought
we to refuse to pay them too?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. That's as you think best. If your
own children are hungry, naturally you should first
feed them.</p>

<p>PEASANT. So you think soldiers are not wanted
at all?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. What good do they do? Millions
and millions are collected from you and your folk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
for them&mdash;it's no joke to clothe and feed such a
host! There are nearly a million of those idlers,
and they're only useful to keep the land from
you; and it is on you they will fire.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>The</i> PEASANT <i>sighs, and shakes his head</i>.</p>

<p>PEASANT. That's true enough! If everybody
were to do it at once ... but if one or two make
a stand, they'll be shot or sent to Siberia, and that
will be the end of the matter.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. And yet there are men, even now&mdash;young
men&mdash;who by themselves stand up for
the Law of God, and refuse to serve. They say:
"According to Christ's Law, I dare not be a
murderer! Do as you please, but I won't take
a rifle in my hands!"</p>

<p>PEASANT. Well, and what happens?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. They are put in prison; they remain
there, poor fellows, three years, or four.... But
I've heard that it's not so bad for them, for the
authorities themselves respect them. And some
are even let out as unfit for service&mdash;bad health!
Though he is sometimes a strapping, broad-shouldered
fellow, he's "not fit," because they're
afraid of taking a man of that kind, for fear he
should tell others that soldiering is against God's
Law. So they let him go.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Really?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Yes, sometimes it happens that
they are let off; but it also happens that they die
there. Still, soldiers die too, and even get maimed
in service&mdash;lose a leg, or an arm....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>PEASANT. Oh, you're a clever fellow! It would
be a good thing, only it won't work out like that.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Why not?</p>

<p>PEASANT. <i>That's</i> why.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. What's <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>PEASANT. That the authorities have power given
them.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. They only have power, because you
obey them. Do not obey the authorities, and
they won't have any power!</p>

<p>PEASANT. [<i>shakes his head</i>]. You do talk queer!
How can one do without the authorities? It is
quite impossible to do without some authority.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Of course it is! Only whom will
you take for authority&mdash;the policeman, or God?
Whom will you obey&mdash;the policeman, or God?</p>

<p>PEASANT. That goes without saying! No one
is greater than God. To live for God is the chief
thing.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Well, if you mean to live for God,
you must obey God and not man. And if you
live according to God, you will not drive people off
the land: you will not be a policeman, a village
elder, a tax-collector, a watchman, or above all, a
soldier.... You will not promise to kill men.</p>

<p>PEASANT. And how about those long-maned
fellows&mdash;the priests? They must see that things
are being done not according to God's Law. Then
why don't they teach how it ought to be?</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. I don't know anything about that.
Let them go their way, and you go yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>PEASANT. They are long-maned devils!</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. It's not right to judge others like
that! We must each remember our own faults.</p>

<p>PEASANT. Yes, that's right enough. [<i>Long pause.
The</i> PEASANT <i>shakes his head, and smiles</i>.] What
it comes to is this: that if we all were to tackle
it at once, the land would be ours at one go, and
there would be no more taxes.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. No, friend, that's not what I mean.
I don't mean that if we live according to God's will,
the land will be ours, and there will be no more
taxes. I mean that our life is evil, only because
we ourselves do evil. If one lived according to
God's will, life would not be evil. What our life
would be like if we lived according to God's will,
God alone knows; but certainly life would not
be evil. We drink, scold, fight, go to law, envy,
and hate men; we do not accept God's Law; we
judge others; call one fat-paunched and another
long-maned; but if any one offers us money, we
are ready to do anything for it: go as watchmen,
policemen, or soldiers, to help ruin others, and
to kill our own brothers. We ourselves live like
devils, and yet we complain of others!</p>

<p>PEASANT. That's so! But it is hard, oh, how
hard! Sometimes it's more than one can bear.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. But, for our souls' sakes, we must
bear it.</p>

<p>PEASANT. That's quite right.... We live
badly, because we forget God.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Yes, that's it! That's why life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
is evil. Take the Revolutionaries; they say:
"Let's kill this or that squire, or these fat-paunched
rich folk (it's all because of them); and
then our life will be happy." So they kill, and
go on killing, and it profits them nothing. It's
the same with the authorities: "Give us time!"
they say, "and we'll hang, and do to death in the
prisons, a thousand or a couple of thousand people,
and then life will become good...." But it
only gets worse and worse!</p>

<p>PEASANT. Yes, that's just it! How can judging
and punishing do any good? It must be
done according to God's Law.</p>

<p>TRAVELLER. Yes, that is just it. You must
serve either God or the devil. If it's to be the
devil, go and drink, scold, fight, hate, covet, don't
obey God's Law, but man's laws, and life will be
evil. If it is God, obey Him alone. Don't rob
or kill, and don't even condemn, and do not hate
any one. Do not plunge into evil actions, and
then there will be no evil life.</p>

<p>PEASANT [<i>sighs</i>]. You speak well, daddy, very
well&mdash;only we are taught so little! Oh, if we
were taught more like that, things would be quite
different! But people come from the town, and
chatter about their way of bettering things: they
chatter fine, but there's nothing in it.... Thank
you, daddy, your words are good!... Well,
where will you sleep? On the oven, yes?...
The missis will make up a bed for you.</p>

<h2 id="talk">A TALK WITH A WAYFARER</h2>


<p>I have come out early. My soul feels light
and joyful. It is a wonderful morning. The
sun is only just appearing from behind the trees.
The dew glitters on them and on the grass. Everything
is lovely; everyone is lovable. It is so
beautiful that, as the saying has it, "One does not
want to die." And, really, I do not want to die.
I would willingly live a little longer in this world
with such beauty around me and such joy in my
heart. That, however, is not my affair, but the
Master's....</p>

<p>I approach the village. Before the first house
I see a man standing, motionless, sideways to me.
He is evidently waiting for somebody or something,
and waiting as only working people know
how to wait, without impatience or vexation. I
draw nearer: he is a bearded, strong, healthy
peasant, with shaggy, slightly grey hair, and a
simple, worker's face. He is smoking not a
"cigar" twisted out of paper, but a short pipe.
We greet one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where does old Alexéy live?" I ask.</p>

<p>"I don't know, friend; we are strangers
here."</p>

<p>Not "<i>I</i> am a stranger," but "<i>we</i> are strangers."
A Russian is hardly ever alone. If he is doing
something wrong, he may perhaps say "I"; otherwise
it is always "we" the family, "we" the
<i>artél</i>, "we" the Commune.</p>

<p>"Strangers? Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"We are from Kaloúga."</p>

<p>I point to his pipe. "And how much do you
spend a year on smoking? Three or more roubles,
I daresay!"</p>

<p>"Three? That would hardly be enough."</p>

<p>"Why not give it up?"</p>

<p>"How can one give it up when one's accustomed
to it?"</p>

<p>"I also used to smoke, but have given it up ...
and I feel so well&mdash;so free!"</p>

<p>"Well of course ... but it's dull without
it."</p>

<p>"Give it up, and the dulness will go! Smoking
is no good, you know!"</p>

<p>"No good at all."</p>

<p>"If it's no good, you should not do it. Seeing
you smoke, others will do the same ... especially
the young folk. They'll say, 'If the old
folk smoke, God himself bids us do it!'"</p>

<p>"That's true enough."</p>

<p>"And your son, seeing you smoke, will do it
too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, my son too...."</p>

<p>"Well then, give it up!"</p>

<p>"I would, only it's so dull without it.... It's
chiefly from dulness. When one feels dull, one has
a smoke. That's where the mischief lies.... It's
dull! At times it's so dull ... so dull ... so
dull!" drawled he.</p>

<p>"The best remedy for that is to think of one's
soul."</p>

<p>He threw a glance at me, and at once the
expression of his face quite changed: instead
of his former kindly, humorous, lively and
talkative expression, he became attentive and
serious.</p>

<p>"'Think of the soul ... of the soul,' you
say?" he asked, gazing questioningly into my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes! When you think of the soul, you give
up all foolish things."</p>

<p>His face lit up affectionately.</p>

<p>"You are right, daddy! You say truly. To
think of the soul is the great thing. The soul's
the chief thing...." He paused. "Thank you,
daddy, it is quite true"; and he pointed to his
pipe. "What is it?... Good-for-nothing rubbish!
The soul's the chief thing!" repeated he.
"What you say is true," and his face grew still
kindlier and more serious.</p>

<p>I wished to continue the conversation, but a
lump rose in my throat (I have grown very weak
in the matter of tears), and I could not speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
With a joyful, tender feeling I took leave of him,
swallowing my tears, and I went away.</p>

<p>Yes, how can one help being joyful, living
amid such people? How can one help expecting
from such people all that is most excellent?</p>

<h2 id="diary">FROM THE DIARY</h2>


<p>I am again staying with my friend, Tchertkóff,
in the Moscow Government, and am visiting him
now for the same reason that once caused us to
meet on the border of the Orlóf Government, and
that brought me to the Moscow Government a
year ago. The reason is that Tchertkóff is allowed
to live anywhere in the whole world, except in
Toúla Government. So I travel to different ends
of it to see him.</p>

<p>Before eight o'clock I go out for my usual walk.
It is a hot day. At first I go along the hard clay
road, past the acacia bushes already preparing to
crack their pods and shed their seeds; then past
the yellowing rye-field, with its still fresh and
lovely cornflowers, and come out into a black
fallow field, now almost all ploughed up. To the
right an old man, in rough peasant-boots, ploughs
with a <i>sohá</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and a poor, skinny horse; and I hear
an angry old voice shout: "Gee-up!" and, from
time to time, "Now, you devil!" and again,
"Gee-up, devil!" I want to speak with him;
but when I pass his furrow, he is at the other end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the field. I go on. There is another ploughman
further on. This one I shall probably meet
when he reaches the road. If so, I'll speak to him,
if there is a chance. And we do meet just as he
reaches the road.</p>


<p>He ploughs with a proper plough, harnessed to
a big roan horse, and is a well-built young lad,
well clad, and wearing good boots; and he answers
my greeting of "God aid you!" pleasantly.</p>

<p>The plough does not cut into the hard, beaten
track that crosses the field, and he lifts it over and
halts.</p>

<p>"You find the plough better than a <i>sohá</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly ... much easier!"</p>

<p>"Have you had it long?"</p>

<p>"Not long&mdash;and it nearly got stolen...."</p>

<p>"But you got it back?"</p>

<p>"Yes! One of our own villagers had it."</p>

<p>"Well, and did you have the law of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, naturally!"</p>

<p>"But why prosecute, if you got the plough
back?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, he's a thief!"</p>

<p>"What then? The man will go to prison, and
learn to steal worse!"</p>

<p>He looks at me seriously and attentively,
evidently neither agreeing nor contradicting this,
to him, new idea.</p>

<p>He has a fresh, healthy, intelligent face, with
hair just appearing on his chin and upper lip, and
with intelligent grey eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaves the plough, evidently wishing to have
a rest, and inclined for a talk. I take the plough-handles,
and touch the perspiring, well-fed, full-grown
mare. She presses her weight into her
collar, and I take a few steps. But I do not
manage the plough, the share jumps out of the
furrow, and I stop the horse.</p>

<p>"No, you can't do it."</p>

<p>"I have only spoilt your furrow."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter&mdash;I'll put it right!"</p>

<p>He backs his horse, to plough the part I have
missed, but does not go on ploughing.</p>

<p>"It is hot in the sun.... Let's go and sit
under the bushes," says he, pointing to a little
wood just across the field.</p>

<p>We go into the shade of the young birches.
He sits down on the ground, and I stop in front
of him.</p>

<p>"What village are you from?"</p>

<p>"From Botvínino."</p>

<p>"Is that far?"</p>

<p>"There it is, shimmering on the hill," says
he, pointing.</p>

<p>"Why are you ploughing so far from
home?"</p>

<p>"This is not my land: it belongs to a peasant
here. I have hired myself out to him."</p>

<p>"Hired yourself out for the whole summer?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;to plough this ground twice, and sow it,
all properly."</p>

<p>"Has he much land, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he sows about fifteen bushels of seed."</p>

<p>"Does he! And is that horse your own? It's
a good horse."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's not a bad mare," he answers, with
quiet pride.</p>

<p>The mare really is, in build, size, and condition,
such as a peasant rarely possesses.</p>

<p>"I expect you are in service somewhere, and do
carting?"</p>

<p>"No, I live at home. I'm my own master!"</p>

<p>"What, so young?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I was left fatherless at seven. My
brother works at a Moscow factory. At first my
sister helped; she also worked at a factory. But
since I was fourteen I've had no help in all my
affairs, and have worked and earned," says he,
with calm consciousness of his dignity.</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, who does your housework?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother!"</p>

<p>"And you have a cow?"</p>

<p>"Two cows."</p>

<p>"Have you, really?... And how old are
you?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Eighteen," he replies, with a slight smile,
understanding that it interests me to see that so
young a fellow has been able to manage so well.
This, evidently, pleases him.</p>

<p>"How young you still are!" I say. "And
will you have to go as a soldier?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course ... be conscripted!" says he,
with the calm expression with which people speak
of old age, death, and in general of things it is
useless to argue about, because they are unavoidable.</p>

<p>As always happens now when one speaks to
peasants, our talk touches on the land, and, describing
his life, he says he has not enough land,
and that if he did not do wage-labour, sometimes
with and sometimes without his horse, he would
not have anything to live on. But he says this
with merry, pleased and proud self-satisfaction;
and again remarks that he was left alone, master
of the house, when he was fourteen, and has
earned everything himself.</p>

<p>"And do you drink vódka?"</p>

<p>He evidently does not like to say that he does,
and still does not wish to tell a lie.</p>

<p>"I do," he says, softly, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"And can you read and write?"</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"And haven't you read books about strong
drink?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't."</p>

<p>"Well, but wouldn't it be better not to drink
at all?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Little good comes of it."</p>

<p>"Then why not give it up?"</p>

<p>He is silent, evidently understanding, and thinking
it over.</p>

<p>"It can be done, you know," say I, "and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a good thing it would be!... The day before
yesterday I went to Ívino. When I reached one
of the houses, the master came out to greet me,
calling me by name. It turned out that we had
met twelve years before.... It was Koúzin&mdash;do
you know him?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do! Sergéy Timoféevitch, you
mean?"</p>

<p>I tell him how we started a Temperance Society
twelve years ago with Koúzin, who, though he
used to drink, has quite given it up, and now tells
me he is very glad to be rid of so nasty a habit;
and, one sees, is living well, with his house and
everything well managed, and who, had he not
given up drinking, would have had none of these
things.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so!"</p>

<p>"Well then, you know, you should do the
same. You are such a nice, good lad.... What
do you need vódka for, when you say yourself
there is no good in it?... You, too, should give
it up!... It would be such a good thing!"</p>

<p>He remains silent, and looks at me intently.
I prepare to go, and hold out my hand to
him.</p>

<p>"Truly, give it up from now! It would be
such a good thing!"</p>

<p>With his strong hand he firmly presses mine,
evidently regarding my gesture as challenging him
to promise.</p>

<p>"Very well then ... it can be done!" says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
quite unexpectedly, and in a joyous and resolute
tone.</p>

<p>"Do you really promise?" say I, surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, of course! I promise," he says, nodding
his head and smiling slightly.</p>

<p>The quiet tone of his voice, and his serious,
attentive face, show that he is not joking, but
that he is really making a promise he means to
keep.</p>

<p>Old age or illness, or both together, has made
me very ready to cry when I am touched with joy.
The simple words of that kindly, firm, strong man,
so evidently ready for all that is good, and standing
so alone, touch me so that sobs rise to
my throat, and I step aside, unable to utter a
word.</p>

<p>After going a few steps, I regain control of
myself, and turn to him and say (I have already
asked his name):</p>

<p>"Mind, Alexander! ... the proverb says,
'Be slow to promise, but having promised, keep
it!'"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. It will be safe."</p>

<p>I have seldom experienced a more joyful feeling
than I had when I left him.</p>

<p>I have omitted to say that during our talk I
had offered to give him some leaflets on drink
and some booklets. [A man in a neighbouring
village posted up one of those same leaflets on
the wall outside his house lately, but it was pulled
down and destroyed by the policeman.] He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thanked me, and said he would come and fetch
them in the dinner-hour.</p>

<p>He did not come in the dinner-hour, and I,
sinner that I am, suspected that our whole conversation
was not so important to him as it seemed
to me, and that he did not want the books, and
that, in general, I had attributed to him what was
not in him. But he came in the evening, all
perspiring from his work and from the walk.
After finishing his work, he had ridden home,
put up the plough, attended to his horse, and had
now come a quarter of a mile to fetch the books.</p>

<p>I was sitting, with some visitors, on a splendid
veranda, looking out on to flower-beds with ornamental
vases on flower-set mounds&mdash;in short, in
luxurious surroundings such as one is always
ashamed of when one enters into human relations
with working people.</p>

<p>I went out to him, and at once asked, "Have
you not changed your mind? Will you really
keep your promise?"</p>

<p>And again, with the same kindly smile, he
replied, "Of course!... I have already told
mother. She's glad, and thanks you."</p>

<p>I saw a bit of paper behind his ear.</p>

<p>"You smoke?"</p>

<p>"I do," he said, evidently expecting that I
should begin persuading him to leave that off too.
But I did not try to.</p>

<p>He remained silent; and then, by some strange
connection of thoughts (I think he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
interest I felt in his life, and wished to tell me
of the important event awaiting him in the
autumn) he said:</p>

<p>"But I did not tell you.... I am already
betrothed...."</p>

<p>And he smiled, looking questioningly into my
eyes. "It's to be in the autumn!"</p>

<p>"Really! That's a good thing! Where is
she from?"</p>

<p>He told me.</p>

<p>"Has she a dowry?"</p>

<p>"No; what dowry should she have? But she's
a good girl."</p>

<p>The idea came to me to put to him the question
which always interests me when I come in contact
with good young people of our day.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said I, "and forgive my asking&mdash;but
please tell the truth: either do not answer at
all, or tell the whole truth...."</p>

<p>He looked at me quietly and attentively.</p>

<p>"Why should I not tell you?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever sinned with a woman?"</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, he replied
simply:</p>

<p>"God preserve me! There's been nothing of
the sort!"</p>

<p>"That's good, very good!" said I. "I am
glad for you."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to say just then.</p>

<p>"Well then, I will fetch you the books, and
God's help be with you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
And we took leave of one another.</p>

<p>Yes, what a splendid, fertile soil on which to
sow, and what a dreadful sin it is to cast upon it
the seeds of falsehood, violence, drunkenness and
profligacy!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Not in the English sense, for there is no Poor-Law system
entitling the destitute to demand maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> One of the most depressing features of L. N. Tolstoy's environment
is the large number of unemployed and beggars from
the adjacent highway. They wait outside the house for hours
every day for the coming of Leo Nikolayevich. The consciousness
of his inability to render them substantial aid weighs
heavily upon him, as does also the fact that, owing to insurmountable
obstacles, he cannot even feed them, and allow them to sleep
in the house in which he himself lives. These unfortunates surround
Leo Nikolayevich at the steps, and besiege him with
their importunate requests, just at the time when he seeks the
fresh air and is most in need of mental rest and solitude after
long-continued and strenuous mental labour. In view of this
fact, the idea has occurred to some of Leo Nikolayevich's
friends, of establishing in the village of Yásnaya Polyána a
lodging- and eating-house for tramps, the use of which by the
latter would save L. N. unnecessary trouble. The establishment
of such premises&mdash;L. N. has viewed the idea very favourably&mdash;would
at least afford some temporary relief to the wandering
poor who are in dire need. At the same time the peasantry of
Yásnaya Polyána would be relieved of the too heavy burden of
supporting the passing unemployed described by Tolstoy in his
article. Lastly, it would afford Tolstoy, in his declining years,
considerable mental relief, which it would seem that he has more
than deserved by his incessant labours on behalf of distressed
mankind. Perhaps among those who read the present sketches
some will be found who, prompted by the impulses animating
the author, may desire to render some material help towards the
practical realisation of the projected undertaking.</p>

the strongest impression upon me. I regard them
as the most perfect tales ever written. In these
popular stories a thought of the highest purity
reaches us, which to my mind is far more eloquent
than the subtlest forms. The highest art is given
us, and it will survive all times, like Dante,
Shakespeare, the Bible, for here is the Eternal
Truth. It surprises me that people speak more
about the so-called greater works of Tolstoy than
of these little jewels, which are quite unique. If
Tolstoy had written nothing but these short stories,
he would still have belonged to the greatest men
of the world. When writing them he could not
have had a base thought, must have been a friend
of suffering humanity, and a real Christian."</p>

<h3>THE DIVINE AND<br />
THE HUMAN</h3>


<p>The first and second of these stories deal with the
Revolution and its victims. Here is a sympathetic account
of their sufferings while in prison or <i>en route</i> to the place
of exile, with a description of the psychological processes
whereby a young revolutionist, condemned to death by
hanging, is led to a full and satisfactory understanding of
the meaning of Life by reading the Beatitudes. There is
an immediate response from within, and Svetlogoub
endures the cross, forgives his murderers, and dies with a
smile on his face.</p>

<p>Another revolutionist, a materialist, becoming convinced
of the stupidity of existence and the hopelessness of the
struggle against reaction, commits suicide in his cell, while
an old sectarian prisoner dies happily, invoking the Lamb
of God.</p>

<p>Here also is the story of a young Pole, who, on being
banished to a distant province, tries to escape, but is recaptured,
sentenced to receive "a thousand stripes," and
finally sent to Siberia for life.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
